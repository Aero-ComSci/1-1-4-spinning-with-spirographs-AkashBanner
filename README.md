# 1.1.4Spirographs

*Complete the following.*

1. Compare and contrast zero-iteration conditions and infinite loops.

Zero iteration conditions occur when the starting condition for a loop is always false, and thus the loop never executes in the first place. However, infinite loops occur when the starting condition for a loop is true and never becomes false, and thus, runs indefinitely. Zero-iteration conditions are useful for scenarios in which it is essential for initial loop conditions to not be met, and infinite loops are essential for continuous executions, which there often being internal mechanisms to break out of the loop.

Infinite loops: 
```python
while True:
    try:
        num_squares = int(input("Enter the number of squares to draw (between 1 and 15): "))
        if num_squares <= 0:
            print("Please enter a positive integer between 1 and 15.")
        elif num_squares > 15:
            print("Please enter a positive integer between 1 and 15.")
        else:
            break
    except ValueError:
        print("Invalid input. Please enter a valid integer.")
```
Zero iteration conditions:
```python
for i in range(num_squares):
    fill_color = fill_colors[i % len(fill_colors)]
    border_color = border_colors[(i + 1) % len(border_colors)]
    # Drawing code
    size -= step
```
This loop won't run if num_squares is 0 in the draw_squares_with_borders function.

3. A link to your code where you solve the following problem. Take the screen size of 800px. Create code or algorithm that always places the object(s), up to 5, in the center an equal distance from one another and from the edges of the screen.

```python
def draw_squares_with_borders(turtle_obj, num_squares, base_size, step):
    # Draws a series of squares with varying sizes, filled colors, and borders.
    size = base_size + (num_squares - 1) * step
    fill_colors = ["red", "blue", "green", "yellow", "purple", "orange", "pink", "cyan", "magenta", "brown"]
    border_colors = ["black", "grey", "white", "darkblue", "darkgreen", "darkred", "darkorange", "darkviolet", "darkcyan", "darkbrown"]

    turtle_obj.penup()
    turtle_obj.goto(-size / 2, size / 2)
    turtle_obj.pendown()
    random_fill_color = (random.random(), random.random(), random.random())  # Randomized color for fills of each concentric square.
    draw_filled_square(turtle_obj, size, random_fill_color)
    draw_square_border(turtle_obj, size + step, border_colors[0], 3)
```

5. Concentric Squares -- Add a screenshot of your result and the code to create it on your repo.
Objective: Write a Python program using the turtle module to draw a pattern of concentric squares. The pattern should be created using nested loops.



https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d5b848ec-ba74-4fab-a62a-37289144f923



Instructions:

Setup the Turtle Environment:
Import the turtle module.
Create a turtle object.
Set the turtle speed to the fastest setting.
Draw Concentric Squares:
Use a nested loop to draw multiple squares.
The outer loop should control the number of squares.
The inner loop should draw each square.
Each square should be slightly larger than the previous one.
Customize the Pattern:
Use different colors for each square.
Ensure the squares are centered on the screen.
Example Output:

The turtle should draw a series of squares, each one larger than the last, creating a pattern of concentric squares.

Hints:

Use the penup() and pendown() methods to move the turtle without drawing.
Use the color() method to change the turtleâ€™s color.
Use the forward() and right() methods to draw the sides of the squares.


4. Complete the steps 17, 18 and 19 from [mypltw use clever to sign on](https://pltw.read.inkling.com/a/b/5310c007377c46e28d745961310f0c2e/p/728c751a6c4145bea0ea83c5058fb9f9#44b0003a2ee14fcc9865e7bb5faec747)

Step 17:
```python
import turtle as trtl

painter = trtl.Turtle()
painter.penup()
painter.goto(-200, 0)
painter.pendown()

x = -200
y = 0
move_x = 1
move_y = 1

# First peak
while (x < 1):  # Moving towards the first peak
    while (y < 100):  # Going up the peak
        x = x + move_x
        y = y + move_y
        painter.goto(x, y)
    move_y = -1  # Change direction to go down

    while (y > 0):  # Coming down
        x = x + move_x
        y = y + move_y
        painter.goto(x, y)
    move_y = 1  # Reset to go up again

# Reset for the second peak
x = 0  # Move the starting point for the second peak
y = 0

# Second peak
while (x < 0):  # Moving towards the second peak
    while (y < 100):  # Going up the second peak
        x = x + move_x
        y = y + move_y
        painter.goto(x, y)
    move_y = -1  # Change direction to go down

    while (y > 0):  # Coming down
        x = x + move_x
        y = y + move_y
        painter.goto(x, y)
    move_y = 1  # Reset for next peak (if needed)

# Keep the window open
wn = trtl.Screen()
wn.mainloop()
```
Step 18:
```python
import turtle as trtl

painter = trtl.Turtle()
painter.penup()
painter.goto(-200, 0)
painter.pendown()

def draw_rhombus(start_x, start_y):
    x = start_x
    y = start_y
    move_x = 100
    move_y = 100

    painter.goto(x + move_x, y + move_y)
    painter.goto(x + 2 * move_x, y)
    painter.goto(x + move_x, y - move_y)
    painter.goto(x, y)

draw_rhombus(-200, 0)

painter.penup()
painter.goto(0, 0)
painter.pendown()
painter.setheading(270)
draw_rhombus(0, 0)

wn = trtl.Screen()
wn.mainloop()
```
Step 19:
```python
import turtle as trtl

painter = trtl.Turtle()
painter.penup()
painter.goto(-200, 0)
painter.pendown()

def draw_rhombus(start_x, start_y):
    x = start_x
    y = start_y
    move_x = 100
    move_y = 100

    painter.goto(x + move_x, y + move_y)
    painter.goto(x + 2 * move_x, y)
    painter.goto(x + move_x, y - move_y)
    painter.goto(x, y)

draw_rhombus(-200, 0)
painter.penup()
painter.goto(0, 0)
painter.pendown()
draw_rhombus(0, 0)

start_x = 200

while True:
    painter.penup()
    painter.goto(start_x, 0)
    painter.pendown()
    draw_rhombus(start_x, 0)
    start_x += 200

wn = trtl.Screen()
wn.mainloop()
```

10. Give an example of an undecidable problem, attach code.
ChatGPT gave the idea of a Halting Problem:
```python
def halting_function(program, input_value):
    try:
        exec(program)  # Executes the given program code
    except Exception as e:
        return "Program crashed or did not halt"

# Example program code as a string
program_code = """
def example_program():
    while True:
        pass  # This will run indefinitely

example_program()
"""

# Check if the example program halts
result = halting_function(program_code, None)
print(result)
```
