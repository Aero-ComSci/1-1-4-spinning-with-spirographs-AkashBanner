Zero iteration conditions occur when the starting condition for a loop is always false, and thus the loop never executes in the first place. However, infinite loops occur when the starting condition for a loop is true and never becomes false, and thus, runs indefinitely. Zero-iteration conditions are useful for scenarios in which it is essential for initial loop conditions to not be met, and infinite loops are essential for continuous executions, which there often being internal mechanisms to break out of the loop.
